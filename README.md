# Fuel-Fiend

Welcome to Fuel Fiend! This app is designed to help you with calculating the cost of the gas you use every week, in order to help you budget. Just enter your vehicle's make, model, and year, as well as your zip code and average weekly mileage, and we'll do the rest!

You are also able to store any vehicles used on your local storage, so you won't have to enter the same information every time! Just open the application and hit go. Presto!

## Technologies used

To build this application, we used two server-side API's to find the most recent gas prices and fuel economy data points, as well as the css framework, Tailwind. You can find the API used to find gas prices [here](), and the API used for fuel economy data points [here](). If you want, you can also find the most recent version of Tailwind css [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/).

## Here's what it looks like:

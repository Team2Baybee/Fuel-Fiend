# Fuel-Fiend

Welcome to Fuel Fiend! This app is designed to help you with calculating the cost of the gas you use every week, in order to help you budget. Just enter your vehicle's make, model, and year, as well as your zip code and average weekly mileage, and we'll do the rest!

You are also able to store any vehicles used on your local storage, so you won't have to enter the same information every time! Just open the application and hit go. Presto!

## Technologies used

To build this application, we used the css framework, Tailwind, as well as two server-side API's. One to take a given zip code and find the most recent gas prices for the region using a separate website, and another to find recent fuel economy data points. You can find the API used to translate zip codes to latitude and longitude numbers [here](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html), and the API used for fuel economy data points [here](https://api-ninjas.com/api/cars). If you want, you can also find the most recent version of Tailwind css [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/).

## Here's what it looks like:
